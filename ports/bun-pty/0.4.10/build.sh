# bumped and point rust-pty/Cargo.toml at that path (already done by

# The CI image doesn't ship bun (only node/python/devel-base, per
# setup-tools.sh), but the functional test below needs it — bun-pty is a
# bun-only package (bun:ffi), so this can't be swapped for a node check.
# Pulling it from our own tap:
#  - `brew tap`/`install` need an explicit HTTPS URL: this repo's git remotes
#    are SSH-only, which an anonymous CI runner can't auth against, but the
#    same repo is also a public, anonymously-clonable HTTPS remote.
#  - harmonybrew refuses to load formulas from a tap it hasn't been told to
#    trust yet (a third-party-tap safety gate, not standard Homebrew) — bun
#    pulls in bun-bootstrap as a dependency, which trips this on first use.
#  - some containers are missing the device-side OHOS ELF loader path
#    (`/system/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`, only `/lib/...` exists), which
#    breaks execution of any OHOS-native binary, bun's own post-install
#    self-check included. The symlink is idempotent and harmless if the
#    container already has it.
